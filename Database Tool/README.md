# Steps for Using the Database Tool
## Installation and Setup
1. Open up a program on your computer called “Command Prompt” for Windows computers and “Terminal” for Mac computers. From there, type the following commands with an enter after each:
   
    - cd Downloads/Princess-Vlei-2-Main/Princess-Vlei-2-Main/Database Tool
    - npm install
    - npm start
2. This should open the application on your computer, and it will stay at that link so long as the command prompt/terminal is open. If you ever want to close the application, you can close the command prompt/terminal. To ever reopen the application, you only have to run the first and last command from the first step.
